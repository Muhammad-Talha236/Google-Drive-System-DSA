# ☁️ Google Drive System (C++ + Data Structures)

A console-based simulation of **Google Drive** built using **C++** and core **data structures**.  
This project demonstrates the use of trees, stacks, and hash tables to manage file storage, directory navigation, and user operations.

## 📁 Features

- Create, upload, and delete files and folders
- Navigate directory structure (similar to Google Drive)
- Track recent files using stack
- Use hash table for efficient file lookup
- Tree structure to simulate folder hierarchy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Data Structures:** Tree, Stack, Hash Map
- **Concepts:** File I/O, Classes & Objects, Menus, Searching

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
